Soooo..

you built this app a long time ago 
probably

and it's not very intuitive cause you built it while learning

to start the application run -> python app2.py

and to reset the databases run -> python create_db.py 

In the env file, (it's ignored by github so you'll need to create it manually on every device that runs this) you need:
SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
ADMIN_PW =
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=

The first is just for flask encoding requests (ig)
the second one is the url for the database.
I think you need to use PgAdmin and postgresql and SQLAlchemy, buttttt maybe you can use whatever you like
The third is the password for the admin of the page, the person that can add products and view orders
the two remaining are the Keys for the stripe API (manages payment) https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

Soooooooooooooooo
 what now
inside the app folder there are different py-files.
The most important ones are 
a) __init__.py (called by app2.py)
b) routes.py (manages the routes on the website) -- if you don't understand this stuff simply paste it into chatgpt. it's REALLY good at resuming the different paths

In models, forms, etc are templates for the db and the user login

functions is just a random sheet for functions, that would distract in routes

templates contains the htmls 

static contains the styles (and the scripts if I have moved them T-T), icons, pics, etc

Okay, you can activate the website via waitress too:

in the virtual environment execute::
    waitress-serve --listen=127.0.0.1:5050 app2:app


btw TODO's:
logging user requests || DONE
change GMX to IONOS with domain etc 
test preorder functions
